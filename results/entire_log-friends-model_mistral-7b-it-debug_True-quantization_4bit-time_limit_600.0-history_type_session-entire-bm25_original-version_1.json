A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date.

Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh!

Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint!

I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.

Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell!

Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\nRachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe!

A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.

This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell!

Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #2]\nMonica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.\nChandler:  Tuna or egg salad?

Well, it matters to me!\nPhoebe:  If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.\nChandler:  Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.\nJoey: I say push her down the stairs.\nPhoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\nRachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\nRoss: You can see where he'd have trouble.\nRachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\nMonica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\nRachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money.

Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.\nJoey:  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\nMonica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\nJoey: What, like there's a rule or something?\nChandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.\nPaul:  It's, uh, it's Paul.\nMonica: Oh God, is it 6:30?

Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\nPhoebe:  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...\nRachel: I'm all better now.\nPhoebe:  I helped!\nMonica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.\nJoey:  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\nMonica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\nJoey: What, like there's a rule or something?\nChandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.\nPaul:  It's, uh, it's Paul.\nMonica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!\nJoey: Who's Paul?\nRoss: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\nMonica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\nRoss: He finally asked you out?\nMonica: Yes!\nChandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.\nMonica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...\nRachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!\nMonica:  Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\nRoss:  That'd be good...\nMonica:  Really?\nRoss:  No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!\nPhoebe: What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?\nMonica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\nAll: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!\nChandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\nMonica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...\nRoss: A wandering?\nMonica: Change!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.\nPhoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes.

And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.

Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?!

Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\nPhoebe:  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...\nRachel: I'm all better now.\nPhoebe:  I helped!\nMonica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.\nJoey:  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall.

I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.\nMonica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.\nRachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.\nPhoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.\nRachel: Thank you.\nPhoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.\nRoss: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...\nMonica: All right, you ready?\nRachel: No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  \"Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\"  Come on, I can't do this!\nMonica: You can, I know you can!\nRachel: I don't think so.\nRoss: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!\nRoss: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...\nRachel: Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...\nMonica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\nChandler:  Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.\nMonica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!\nMonica: Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?\nRoss: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.\nMonica: You be okay?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?\nMonica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.\nRoss and Rachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Mmm.  Oh, no-\nRachel: Sorry-\nRoss: No no no, go-\nRachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-\nRoss: Split it?\nRachel: Okay.\nRoss: Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.\nRachel: I knew.\nRoss: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.\nRachel: I did.\nRoss: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?\n\n[Date: September 23, 1994, Session #2]\nRachel: Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?

I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\n\n",

This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone.

I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell!

Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-\nMonica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.\nMrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that...\nMonica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?\nRoss: Yeah.\nMrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.\nMonica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\nMrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.\nMr. Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!\nMrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...\nMonica: What's that supposed to mean?\nMrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.\nMonica: No it's not.\nMr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...\nMr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\nMr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.\nMonica:  So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\nRoss:  Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #3]\nMrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm! What's that curry taste?\nMonica: Curry.\nMrs. Geller: Mmmm!\nRoss: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.\nMr. Geller:  Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?\nMrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him.\nRoss: Aw, Mom...\nMonica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?\nMrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or....

Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint!

It's an expression.\nMonica: No it's not.\nMr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been!

There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.

'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\nMonica: Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!\nChandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!\nJoey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #2]\nChandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.\nPhoebe:...Then I've already seen this one!\nMonica:  Are you through with that?\nJoey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\nMonica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!\nChandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.\nPhoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!\nMonica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\nChandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\nPhoebe: Monica- Hi!

There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell!

See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.\nPhoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!\nMonica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\nChandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\nPhoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.\nJoey: Yeah, calm down.

A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax.

I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.

He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just...

Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-\nMonica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.\nMrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that...\nMonica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?\nRoss: Yeah.\nMrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.\nMonica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\nMrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.\nMr. Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!\nMrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...\nMonica: What's that supposed to mean?\nMrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.\nMonica: No it's not.\nMr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...\nMr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\nMr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.\nMonica:  So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #3]\nMrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm! What's that curry taste?\nMonica: Curry.\nMrs. Geller: Mmmm!\nRoss: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.\nMr. Geller:  Do you remember the Ludwins?

Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.\nMrs. Geller:  And you knew about this?!\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #3]\nMrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.

A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone.

Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint!

I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.

I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #3]\nMrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm! What's that curry taste?\nMonica: Curry.\nMrs. Geller: Mmmm!\nRoss: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.\nMr. Geller:  Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?\nMrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him.\nRoss: Aw, Mom...\nMonica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?\nMrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-\nMonica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.\nMrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that...\nMonica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?\nRoss: Yeah.\nMrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.\nMonica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\nMrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.\nMr. Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!\nMrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...\nMonica: What's that supposed to mean?\nMrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.\nMonica: No it's not.\nMr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...\nMr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\nMr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.\nMonica:  So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #2]\nChandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.\nPhoebe:...Then I've already seen this one!\nMonica:  Are you through with that?\nJoey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\nMonica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!\nChandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.\nPhoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!\nMonica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\nChandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\nPhoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.\nJoey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\nMonica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.\nChandler:  Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!\nMonica: What?\nChandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!\nAll: Eeaagh!\nRachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?\nPhoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful.\nRachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....\nPhoebe: No, look, don't touch that!\nRachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\nMonica: Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!\nChandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!\nJoey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?\nPhoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!\nChandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...\nRachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...\nChandler: ...Dinah?\nRachel:  Ohhhhh, don't be mad...\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #2]\nChandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.\nPhoebe:...Then I've already seen this one!\nMonica:  Are you through with that?\nJoey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\nMonica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!\nChandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine.

Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?\nRoss: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...\nRachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?\nRoss: Got me.\nRachel: Remember when we were in high school together?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross?\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #2]\nChandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.\nPhoebe:...Then I've already seen this one!\nMonica:  Are you through with that?\nJoey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\nMonica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!\nChandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine.

We're going in.\nRoss: .....Hi.\nMonica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.\nRoss: Carol's pregnant.\nPhoebe:  Ooh! I found it!\nMonica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...\nRoss: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.\nChandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?\nRachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?\nRoss: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.\nPhoebe: She is so great! I miss her.\nMonica: What does she mean by 'involved'?\nChandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.\nRoss: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #2]\nChandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.\nPhoebe:...Then I've already seen this one!\nMonica:  Are you through with that?\nJoey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\nMonica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!\nChandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.\nPhoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!\nMonica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\nChandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\nPhoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.\nJoey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\nMonica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.\nChandler:  Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!\nMonica: What?\nChandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!\nAll: Eeaagh!\nRachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?\nPhoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful.\nRachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....\nPhoebe: No, look, don't touch that!\nRachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\nMonica: Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!\nChandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!\nJoey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?\nPhoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!\nChandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...\nRachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...\nChandler: ...Dinah?\nRachel:  Ohhhhh, don't be mad...\nMonica: You didn't.\nRachel: Oh, I am sorry...\nMonica: I gave you one job!\nRachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!\nChandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...\nMonica:  I just... can't do it.\nChandler: Boys?

No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell!

You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\"  Come on, I can't do this!\nMonica: You can, I know you can!\nRachel: I don't think so.\nRoss: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!\nRoss: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...\nRachel: Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...\nMonica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\nChandler:  Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.\nMonica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!\nMonica: Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?\nRoss: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.\nMonica: You be okay?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?\nMonica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.\nRoss and Rachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Mmm.  Oh, no-\nRachel: Sorry-\nRoss: No no no, go-\nRachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-\nRoss: Split it?\n\n",

There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell!

Mmm! What's that curry taste?\nMonica: Curry.\nMrs. Geller: Mmmm!\nRoss: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.\nMr. Geller:  Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?\nMrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him.\nRoss: Aw, Mom...\nMonica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?\nMrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-\nMonica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.\nMrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that...\nMonica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?\nRoss: Yeah.\nMrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.\nMonica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\nMrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.\nMr. Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!\nMrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...\nMonica: What's that supposed to mean?\nMrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.\nMonica: No it's not.\nMr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...\nMr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\nMr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.\nMonica:  So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\nRoss:  Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell!

Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?

You don't have any of this.\nChandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.\nRachel: The lights, please..\nRoss: ...How long was I in there?\nRachel: I'm just cleaning up.\nRoss: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?\nRachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!\nRoss: Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?\nRachel: Oh.. a little..\nRoss: Mm-hmm..\nRachel: A lot.\nRoss: Mm.\nRachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?\nRoss: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...\n\n",

Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan.

And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat.

The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?\nMrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him.\nRoss: Aw, Mom...\nMonica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?\nMrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or....

That's.... easy.\nMonica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\nMrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.\nMr. Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!\nMrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...\nMonica: What's that supposed to mean?\nMrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.\nMonica: No it's not.\nMr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...\nMr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\nMr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.\nMonica:  So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\nRoss:  Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan.
