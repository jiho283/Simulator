Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #3, Utterance #1] Mrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm!

I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1, Utterance #23] Monica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #1, Utterance #17] Carol: Marty's still totally paranoid.
