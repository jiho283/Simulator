I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.\nJoey: I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.\nChandler: It's a beautiful thing.\nJoey:  What's this?\nChandler: I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.\nJoey: Which goes where?\nChandler: I have no idea.\nJoey: Done with the bookcase!\nChandler: All finished!\nRoss:  This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.\nJoey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.\nChandler: Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.\nJoey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?\nRoss: You guys.\nChandler: Oh, God.\nJoey: You got screwed.\nChandler: Oh my God!\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #4]\nRoss: I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!\nJoey: Shut up!\nChandler: You must stop!\nRoss: That only took me an hour.\nChandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!\nRoss: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...\n\n",

I don't think that was my point!\nRoss: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...\nJoey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!\nRoss: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.\nChandler: Stay out of my freezer!\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #5]\nRoss:  Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?\nJoey: Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man,\nChandler: Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.\nJoey: Right.  Thanks.  It's June.

There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #4]\nRoss: I'm divorced!

I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.\nMonica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.\nRachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.\nPhoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.\nRachel: Thank you.\nPhoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.\nRoss: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...\nMonica: All right, you ready?\nRachel: No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  \"Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\"  Come on, I can't do this!\nMonica: You can, I know you can!\nRachel: I don't think so.\nRoss: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!\nRoss: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...\nRachel: Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...\nMonica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\nChandler:  Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.\nMonica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!\nMonica: Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?\nRoss: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.\nMonica: You be okay?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?\nMonica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.\nRoss and Rachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Mmm.  Oh, no-\nRachel: Sorry-\nRoss: No no no, go-\nRachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-\nRoss: Split it?\nRachel: Okay.\nRoss: Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #2]\nMonica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.\nChandler:  Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!\nRoss:  I'll have whatever Christine is having.\nRachel:  Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!\nPhoebe:  If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.\nChandler:  Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.\nJoey: I say push her down the stairs.\nPhoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\nRachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\nRoss: You can see where he'd have trouble.\nRachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\nMonica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\nRachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\nPhoebe:  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...\nRachel: I'm all better now.\nPhoebe:  I helped!\nMonica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.\nJoey:  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\nMonica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\nJoey: What, like there's a rule or something?\nChandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.\nPaul:  It's, uh, it's Paul.\nMonica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!\nJoey: Who's Paul?\nRoss: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\nMonica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\nRoss: He finally asked you out?\nMonica: Yes!\nChandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.\nMonica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...\nRachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!\nMonica:  Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\nRoss:  That'd be good...\nMonica:  Really?\nRoss:  No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!\nPhoebe: What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?\nMonica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\nAll: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!\nChandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\nMonica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...\nRoss: A wandering?\nMonica: Change!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.\nPhoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.\nJoey:  Hey, Paul!\nPaul: Yeah?\nJoey: Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.\nMonica:  Shut up, Joey!\nRoss: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?\nRachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\nRoss: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\nChandler:  Yes, and we're very excited about it.\nRachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.\nRoss: Okay, sure.\nJoey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?\nPhoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.\n\n[Date: September 23, 1994, Session #1]\nJoey: Of course it was a line!\nMonica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?\nRoss: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.\nMonica: I hate men!  I hate men!\nPhoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.\nMonica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?\nPhoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.\nMonica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?\nJoey:  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!\nRachel: Guess what?\nRoss: You got a job?\nRachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.\nChandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.\nRachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!\nChandler: Oh, how well you know me...\nRachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!\nMonica: How'd you pay for them?\nRachel: Uh, credit card.\nMonica: And who pays for that?\nRachel: Um... my... father.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #3]\nRoss:  I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.\nJoey: I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.\nChandler: It's a beautiful thing.\nJoey:  What's this?\nChandler: I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.\nJoey: Which goes where?\nChandler: I have no idea.\nJoey: Done with the bookcase!\nChandler: All finished!\nRoss:  This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.\nJoey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.\nChandler: Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.\nJoey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?\nRoss: You guys.\nChandler: Oh, God.\nJoey: You got screwed.\nChandler: Oh my God!\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #5]\nRoss:  Grab a spoon.

You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!\nRoss: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...\nJoey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world!

But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man,\nChandler: Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.\nJoey: Right.  Thanks.  It's June.  I'm outta here.\nRoss: Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #3]\nRoss:  I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.\nJoey: I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.\nChandler: It's a beautiful thing.\nJoey:  What's this?\nChandler: I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.\nJoey: Which goes where?\nChandler: I have no idea.\nJoey: Done with the bookcase!\nChandler: All finished!\nRoss:  This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.\nJoey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.\nChandler: Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.\nJoey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?\nRoss: You guys.\nChandler: Oh, God.\nJoey: You got screwed.\nChandler: Oh my God!\n\n[Date: September 24, 1994, Session #1]\nJoey: I can't believe what I'm hearing here.\nPhoebe:  I can't believe what I'm hearing here...\nMonica: What?

Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?\nRoss: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.\nMonica: I hate men!  I hate men!\nPhoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.\nMonica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?\nPhoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.\nMonica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?\nJoey:  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!\nRachel: Guess what?\nRoss: You got a job?\nRachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.\nChandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.\nRachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!\nChandler: Oh, how well you know me...\nRachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!\nMonica: How'd you pay for them?\nRachel: Uh, credit card.\nMonica: And who pays for that?\nRachel: Um... my... father.\n\n",

      "[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #2]\nMonica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.\nChandler:  Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!\nRoss:  I'll have whatever Christine is having.\nRachel:  Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!\nPhoebe:  If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.\nChandler:  Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.\nJoey: I say push her down the stairs.\nPhoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\nRachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\nRoss: You can see where he'd have trouble.\nRachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\nMonica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\nRachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\nPhoebe:  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...\nRachel: I'm all better now.\nPhoebe:  I helped!\nMonica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.\nJoey:  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\nMonica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\nJoey: What, like there's a rule or something?\nChandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.\nPaul:  It's, uh, it's Paul.\nMonica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!\nJoey: Who's Paul?\nRoss: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\nMonica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\nRoss: He finally asked you out?\nMonica: Yes!\nChandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.\nMonica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...\nRachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!\nMonica:  Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\nRoss:  That'd be good...\nMonica:  Really?\nRoss:  No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!\nPhoebe: What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?\nMonica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\nAll: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!\nChandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\nMonica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...\nRoss: A wandering?\nMonica: Change!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.\nPhoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.\nJoey:  Hey, Paul!\nPaul: Yeah?\nJoey: Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.\nMonica:  Shut up, Joey!\nRoss: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?\nRachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\nRoss: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\nChandler:  Yes, and we're very excited about it.\nRachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.\nRoss: Okay, sure.\nJoey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?\nPhoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.\n\n[Date: September 23, 1994, Session #2]\nRachel: Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.\nMonica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.\nRachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.\nPhoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.\nRachel: Thank you.\nPhoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.\nRoss: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...\nMonica: All right, you ready?\nRachel: No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  \"Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\"  Come on, I can't do this!\nMonica: You can, I know you can!\nRachel: I don't think so.\nRoss: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!\nRoss: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...\nRachel: Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...\nMonica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\nChandler:  Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.\nMonica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!\nMonica: Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?\nRoss: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.\nMonica: You be okay?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?\nMonica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.\nRoss and Rachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Mmm.  Oh, no-\nRachel: Sorry-\nRoss: No no no, go-\nRachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-\nRoss: Split it?\nRachel: Okay.\nRoss: Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.\nRachel: I knew.\nRoss: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.\nRachel: I did.\nRoss: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?\nRachel: Yeah, maybe...\nRoss: Okay... okay, maybe I will...\nRachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Goodnight.\nMonica: See ya....

That was a library card!\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\nChandler:  Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.\nMonica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!\nMonica: Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?\nRoss: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.\nMonica: You be okay?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?\nMonica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.\nRoss and Rachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Mmm.  Oh, no-\nRachel: Sorry-\nRoss: No no no, go-\nRachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-\nRoss: Split it?\nRachel: Okay.\nRoss: Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.\nRachel: I knew.\nRoss: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.\nRachel: I did.\nRoss: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?\nRachel: Yeah, maybe...\nRoss: Okay... okay, maybe I will...\nRachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Goodnight.\nMonica: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?\nRoss: I just grabbed a spoon.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\n\n[Date: September 23, 1994, Session #1]\nJoey: Of course it was a line!\nMonica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?\nRoss: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.\nMonica: I hate men!  I hate men!\nPhoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.\nMonica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?\nPhoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.\nMonica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?\nJoey:  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!\nRachel: Guess what?\nRoss: You got a job?\nRachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.\nChandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.\nRachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!\nChandler: Oh, how well you know me...\nRachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!\nMonica: How'd you pay for them?\nRachel: Uh, credit card.\nMonica: And who pays for that?\nRachel: Um... my... father.\n\n[Date: September 29, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.\nJoey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah!\nRachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.\nMonica: Absolutely.\nChandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.\nRoss: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.\nChandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.\nRachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.\nJoey: ....Are we still talking about sex?\n\n[Date: September 24, 1994, Session #1]\nJoey: I can't believe what I'm hearing here.\nPhoebe:  I can't believe what I'm hearing here...\nMonica: What? I-I said you had a-\nPhoebe:  What I said you had...\nMonica:  Would you stop?\nPhoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?\nAll: Yes!\nMonica: I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.\nJoey: Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.\nRoss: There's an image.\nRachel:  Would anybody like more coffee?\nChandler: Did you make it, or are you just serving it?\nRachel: I'm just serving it.\nAll: Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.\nChandler: Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.\nCustomer:  Ahh, miss?   More coffee?\nRachel: Ugh.  Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there?  Go ahead.  Thank you.  Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas.\nChandler: Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #4]\nRoss: I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!\nJoey: Shut up!\nChandler: You must stop!\nRoss: That only took me an hour.\nChandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!\nRoss: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...\nJoey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!\nRoss: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.\nChandler: Stay out of my freezer!\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #3]\nRoss:  I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.\nJoey: I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.\nChandler: It's a beautiful thing.\nJoey:  What's this?\nChandler: I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.\nJoey: Which goes where?\nChandler: I have no idea.\nJoey: Done with the bookcase!\nChandler: All finished!\nRoss:  This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.\nJoey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.\nChandler: Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.\nJoey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?\nRoss: You guys.\nChandler: Oh, God.\nJoey: You got screwed.\nChandler: Oh my God!\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #5]\nRoss:  Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you?\nJoey: Great story!  But, I uh, I gotta go, I got a date with Andrea--Angela--Andrea...  Oh man,\nChandler: Angela's the screamer, Andrea has cats.\nJoey: Right.  Thanks.  It's June.  I'm outta here.\nRoss: Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask?\n\n",

Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!\nMonica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\nChandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\nPhoebe: Monica- Hi!

Yeah!\nJoey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?\nPhoebe: Doy!

Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\nPhoebe:  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...\nRachel: I'm all better now.\nPhoebe:  I helped!\nMonica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence.

I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.\nMonica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.\nRachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.\nPhoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.\nRachel: Thank you.\nPhoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.\nRoss: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...\nMonica: All right, you ready?\nRachel: No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  \"Hey, Rach!

I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.\nMonica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.\nRachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.\nPhoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.\nRachel: Thank you.\nPhoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.\nRoss: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...\nMonica: All right, you ready?\nRachel: No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  \"Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\"  Come on, I can't do this!\nMonica: You can, I know you can!\nRachel: I don't think so.\nRoss: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!\nRoss: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...\nRachel: Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...\nMonica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\nChandler:  Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.\nMonica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!\nMonica: Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?\nRoss: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.\nMonica: You be okay?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?\nMonica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.\nRoss and Rachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Mmm.  Oh, no-\nRachel: Sorry-\nRoss: No no no, go-\nRachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-\nRoss: Split it?\nRachel: Okay.\nRoss: Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.\nRachel: I knew.\nRoss: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.\nRachel: I did.\nRoss: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?\nRachel: Yeah, maybe...\nRoss: Okay... okay, maybe I will...\nRachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Goodnight.\nMonica: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?\nRoss: I just grabbed a spoon.\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #2]\nChandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.\nPhoebe:...Then I've already seen this one!\nMonica:  Are you through with that?\nJoey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\nMonica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!\nChandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.\nPhoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!\nMonica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\nChandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\nPhoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.\nJoey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\nMonica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.\nChandler:  Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!\nMonica: What?\nChandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!\nAll: Eeaagh!\nRachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?\nPhoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful.\nRachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....\nPhoebe: No, look, don't touch that!\nRachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\nMonica: Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!\nChandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!\nJoey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?\nPhoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!\nChandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...\nRachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...\nChandler: ...Dinah?\nRachel:  Ohhhhh, don't be mad...\nMonica: You didn't.\nRachel: Oh, I am sorry...\nMonica: I gave you one job!\nRachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!\nChandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...\nMonica:  I just... can't do it.\nChandler: Boys? We're going in.\nRoss: .....Hi.\nMonica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.\nRoss: Carol's pregnant.\nPhoebe:  Ooh! I found it!\nMonica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...\nRoss: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.\nChandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?\nRachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?\nRoss: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.\nPhoebe: She is so great! I miss her.\nMonica: What does she mean by 'involved'?\nChandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.\nRoss: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.\nRachel: So what are you gonna do?\nRoss: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.\nJoey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #4]\nRoss: I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!\nJoey: Shut up!\nChandler: You must stop!\nRoss: That only took me an hour.\nChandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!\nRoss: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...\nJoey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!\nRoss: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.\nChandler: Stay out of my freezer!\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #1]\nRoss: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?\nMarsha: Well, she has issues.\nRoss: Does she.\nMarsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!\nRoss: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?\nMarsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?\nRoss:  No. No.\nMarsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!\nRoss: Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.\nRoss:Hi.\nCarol: So.\nRoss: You look great. I, uh... I hate that.\nCarol: Sorry. You look good too.\nRoss: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...\nCarol: A lesbian?\nRoss: Well... you never know.

Oh, and, uh-\nRoss: Why- why are you here, Carol?\nCarol: I'm pregnant.\nRoss: Pregnant?!\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #3]\nRoss:  I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys.

She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.\nJoey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.\nChandler: Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.\nJoey: Ross, let me ask you a question.

Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?\nRoss: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.\nMonica: I hate men!  I hate men!\nPhoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.\nMonica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?\nPhoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.\nMonica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?\nJoey:  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!\nRachel: Guess what?\nRoss: You got a job?\nRachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.\nChandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.\nRachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!\nChandler: Oh, how well you know me...\nRachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!\nMonica: How'd you pay for them?\nRachel: Uh, credit card.\nMonica: And who pays for that?\nRachel: Um... my... father.\n\n[Date: September 29, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.\nJoey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah!\nRachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.\nMonica: Absolutely.\nChandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.\nRoss: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.\nChandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.\nRachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.\nJoey: ....Are we still talking about sex?\n\n",

Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?\nRoss: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.\nMonica: I hate men!  I hate men!\nPhoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.\nMonica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?\nPhoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.\nMonica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?\nJoey:  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!\nRachel: Guess what?\nRoss: You got a job?\nRachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.\nChandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.\nRachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!\nChandler: Oh, how well you know me...\nRachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!\nMonica: How'd you pay for them?\nRachel: Uh, credit card.\nMonica: And who pays for that?\nRachel: Um... my... father.\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #2]\nChandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.\nPhoebe:...Then I've already seen this one!\nMonica:  Are you through with that?\nJoey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\nMonica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!\nChandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.\nPhoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!\nMonica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\nChandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\nPhoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.\nJoey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\nMonica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.\nChandler:  Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!\nMonica: What?\nChandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!\nAll: Eeaagh!\nRachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?\nPhoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful.\nRachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....\nPhoebe: No, look, don't touch that!\nRachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\nMonica: Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!\nChandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!\nJoey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?\nPhoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!\nChandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...\nRachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...\nChandler: ...Dinah?\nRachel:  Ohhhhh, don't be mad...\nMonica: You didn't.\nRachel: Oh, I am sorry...\nMonica: I gave you one job!\nRachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!\nChandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...\nMonica:  I just... can't do it.\nChandler: Boys? We're going in.\nRoss: .....Hi.\nMonica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.\nRoss: Carol's pregnant.\nPhoebe:  Ooh! I found it!\nMonica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...\nRoss: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.\nChandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?\nRachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?\nRoss: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.\nPhoebe: She is so great! I miss her.\nMonica: What does she mean by 'involved'?\nChandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.\nRoss: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.\nRachel: So what are you gonna do?\nRoss: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.\nJoey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #2]\nMonica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.\nChandler:  Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!\nRoss:  I'll have whatever Christine is having.\nRachel:  Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!\nPhoebe:  If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.\nChandler:  Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.\nJoey: I say push her down the stairs.\nPhoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\nRachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\nRoss: You can see where he'd have trouble.\nRachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\nMonica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\nRachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\nPhoebe:  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...\nRachel: I'm all better now.\nPhoebe:  I helped!\nMonica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.\nJoey:  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\nMonica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\nJoey: What, like there's a rule or something?\nChandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.\nPaul:  It's, uh, it's Paul.\nMonica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!\nJoey: Who's Paul?\nRoss: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\nMonica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\nRoss: He finally asked you out?\nMonica: Yes!\nChandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.\nMonica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...\nRachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!\nMonica:  Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\nRoss:  That'd be good...\nMonica:  Really?\nRoss:  No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!\nPhoebe: What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?\nMonica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\nAll: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!\nChandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\nMonica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...\nRoss: A wandering?\nMonica: Change!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.\nPhoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.\nJoey:  Hey, Paul!\nPaul: Yeah?\nJoey: Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.\nMonica:  Shut up, Joey!\nRoss: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?\nRachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\nRoss: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\nChandler:  Yes, and we're very excited about it.\nRachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.\nRoss: Okay, sure.\nJoey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?\nPhoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.\n\n[Date: September 23, 1994, Session #2]\nRachel: Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.\nMonica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.\nRachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.\nPhoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.\nRachel: Thank you.\nPhoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.\nRoss: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...\nMonica: All right, you ready?\nRachel: No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  \"Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\"  Come on, I can't do this!\nMonica: You can, I know you can!\nRachel: I don't think so.\nRoss: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!\nRoss: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...\nRachel: Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...\nMonica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\nChandler:  Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.\nMonica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!\nMonica: Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?\nRoss: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.\nMonica: You be okay?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?\nMonica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.\nRoss and Rachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Mmm.  Oh, no-\nRachel: Sorry-\nRoss: No no no, go-\nRachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-\nRoss: Split it?\nRachel: Okay.\nRoss: Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.\nRachel: I knew.\nRoss: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.\nRachel: I did.\nRoss: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?\nRachel: Yeah, maybe...\nRoss: Okay... okay, maybe I will...\nRachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Goodnight.\nMonica: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?\nRoss: I just grabbed a spoon.\n\n[Date: September 29, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.\nJoey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah!\nRachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.\nMonica: Absolutely.\nChandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.\nRoss: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.\nChandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.\nRachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.\nJoey: ....Are we still talking about sex?\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #1]\nRoss: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?\nMarsha: Well, she has issues.\nRoss: Does she.\nMarsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!\nRoss: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?\nMarsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?\nRoss:  No. No.\nMarsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!\nRoss: Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.\nRoss:Hi.\nCarol: So.\nRoss: You look great. I, uh... I hate that.\nCarol: Sorry. You look good too.\nRoss: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...\nCarol: A lesbian?\nRoss: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?\nCarol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-\nRoss: Why- why are you here, Carol?\nCarol: I'm pregnant.\nRoss: Pregnant?!\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #4]\nJoey: Your folks are really that bad, huh?\nRoss: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.\nMonica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours.\nRoss: Must pee.\nPhoebe: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.\nRachel: You're twins?\nPhoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.\nChandler: What does she do?\nPhoebe: She's a waitress.\nRachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.\nMonica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.\nChandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.\nRachel: The lights, please..\nRoss: ...How long was I in there?\nRachel: I'm just cleaning up.\nRoss: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?\nRachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!\nRoss: Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?\nRachel: Oh.. a little..\nRoss: Mm-hmm..\nRachel: A lot.\nRoss: Mm.\n\n[Date: September 24, 1994, Session #1]\nJoey: I can't believe what I'm hearing here.\nPhoebe:  I can't believe what I'm hearing here...\nMonica: What? I-I said you had a-\nPhoebe:  What I said you had...\nMonica:  Would you stop?\nPhoebe: Oh, was I doing it again?\nAll: Yes!\nMonica: I said that you had a nice butt, it's just not a great butt.\nJoey: Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.\nRoss: There's an image.\nRachel:  Would anybody like more coffee?\nChandler: Did you make it, or are you just serving it?\nRachel: I'm just serving it.\nAll: Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.\nChandler: Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas.\nCustomer:  Ahh, miss?   More coffee?\nRachel: Ugh.  Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there?  Go ahead.  Thank you.  Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas.\nChandler: Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-\n\n",

What's that curry taste?\nMonica: Curry.\nMrs. Geller: Mmmm!\nRoss: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.\nMr. Geller:  Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?\nMrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him.\nRoss: Aw, Mom...\nMonica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?\nMrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-\nMonica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.\nMrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that...\nMonica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?\nRoss: Yeah.\nMrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.\nMonica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\nMrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.\nMr. Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!\nMrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...\nMonica: What's that supposed to mean?\nMrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.\nMonica: No it's not.\nMr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...\nMr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\nMr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.\nMonica:  So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\nRoss:  Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan.

Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?\nRoss: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...\nRachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow..

See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.\nPhoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!\nMonica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\nChandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\nPhoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.\nJoey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\nMonica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.\nChandler:  Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!\nMonica: What?\nChandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!\nAll: Eeaagh!\nRachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?\nPhoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful.\nRachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....\nPhoebe: No, look, don't touch that!\nRachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\nMonica: Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!\nChandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!\nJoey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?\nPhoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!\nChandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...\nRachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...\nChandler: ...Dinah?\nRachel:  Ohhhhh, don't be mad...\nMonica: You didn't.\nRachel: Oh, I am sorry...\nMonica: I gave you one job!\nRachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!\nChandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...\nMonica:  I just... can't do it.\nChandler: Boys? We're going in.\nRoss: .....Hi.\nMonica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.\nRoss: Carol's pregnant.\nPhoebe:  Ooh! I found it!\nMonica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...\nRoss: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.\nChandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?\nRachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?\nRoss: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.\nPhoebe: She is so great! I miss her.\nMonica: What does she mean by 'involved'?\nChandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.\nRoss: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.\nRachel: So what are you gonna do?\nRoss: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.\nJoey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #2]\nMonica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.\nChandler:  Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!\nRoss:  I'll have whatever Christine is having.\nRachel:  Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!\nPhoebe:  If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.\nChandler:  Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.\nJoey: I say push her down the stairs.\nPhoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\nRachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\nRoss: You can see where he'd have trouble.\nRachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\nMonica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\nRachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\nPhoebe:  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...\nRachel: I'm all better now.\nPhoebe:  I helped!\nMonica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.\nJoey:  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\nMonica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\nJoey: What, like there's a rule or something?\nChandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.\nPaul:  It's, uh, it's Paul.\nMonica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!\nJoey: Who's Paul?\nRoss: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\nMonica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\nRoss: He finally asked you out?\nMonica: Yes!\nChandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.\nMonica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...\nRachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!\nMonica:  Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\nRoss:  That'd be good...\nMonica:  Really?\nRoss:  No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!\nPhoebe: What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?\nMonica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\nAll: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!\nChandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\nMonica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...\nRoss: A wandering?\nMonica: Change!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.\nPhoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.\nJoey:  Hey, Paul!\nPaul: Yeah?\nJoey: Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.\nMonica:  Shut up, Joey!\nRoss: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?\nRachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\nRoss: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\nChandler:  Yes, and we're very excited about it.\nRachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.\nRoss: Okay, sure.\nJoey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?\nPhoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.\n\n[Date: September 29, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.\nJoey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah!\nRachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.\nMonica: Absolutely.\nChandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.\nRoss: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.\nChandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.\nRachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.\nJoey: ....Are we still talking about sex?\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\n\n[Date: October 1, 1994, Session #1]\nRoss:  Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway.\nSusan: Hi.\nCarol: Ross, you remember Susan.\nRoss: How could I forget?\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #4]\nRoss: I'm divorced!  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced!\nJoey: Shut up!\nChandler: You must stop!\nRoss: That only took me an hour.\nChandler: Look, Ross, you gotta understand, between us we haven't had a relationship that has lasted longer than a Mento.   You, however have had the love of a woman for four years.   Four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out, and that is why we don't do it!  I don't think that was my point!\nRoss: You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her...\nJoey: What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavor of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavors out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!\nRoss: I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.\nChandler: Stay out of my freezer!\n\n[Date: September 23, 1994, Session #1]\nJoey: Of course it was a line!\nMonica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?\nRoss: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.\nMonica: I hate men!  I hate men!\nPhoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.\nMonica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?\nPhoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.\nMonica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?\nJoey:  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!\nRachel: Guess what?\nRoss: You got a job?\nRachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.\nChandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.\nRachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!\nChandler: Oh, how well you know me...\nRachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!\nMonica: How'd you pay for them?\nRachel: Uh, credit card.\nMonica: And who pays for that?\nRachel: Um... my... father.\n\n",

They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.\nMonica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours.\nRoss: Must pee.\nPhoebe: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.\nRachel: You're twins?\nPhoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.\nChandler: What does she do?\nPhoebe: She's a waitress.\nRachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.\nMonica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.\nChandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.\nRachel: The lights, please..\nRoss: ...How long was I in there?\nRachel: I'm just cleaning up.\nRoss: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?\nRachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!\nRoss: Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?\nRachel: Oh.. a little..\nRoss: Mm-hmm..\nRachel: A lot.\nRoss: Mm.\nRachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?\nRoss: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...\nRachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?\nRoss: Got me.\nRachel: Remember when we were in high school together?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross?\nRoss: Yes, yes!\nRachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..\nRoss: Me either...\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #3]\nMrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm! What's that curry taste?\nMonica: Curry.\nMrs. Geller: Mmmm!\nRoss: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.\nMr. Geller:  Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?\nMrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him.\nRoss: Aw, Mom...\nMonica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?\nMrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-\nMonica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.\nMrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that...\nMonica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?\nRoss: Yeah.\nMrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.\nMonica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\nMrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.\nMr. Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!\nMrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...\nMonica: What's that supposed to mean?\nMrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.\nMonica: No it's not.\nMr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...\nMr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\nMr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.\nMonica:  So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\nRoss:  Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.\nMrs. Geller:  And you knew about this?!\n\n[Date: September 23, 1994, Session #2]\nRachel: Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.\nMonica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.\nRachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.\nPhoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.\nRachel: Thank you.\nPhoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.\nRoss: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...\nMonica: All right, you ready?\nRachel: No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  \"Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\"  Come on, I can't do this!\nMonica: You can, I know you can!\nRachel: I don't think so.\nRoss: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!\nRoss: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...\nRachel: Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...\nMonica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\nChandler:  Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.\nMonica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!\nMonica: Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?\nRoss: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.\nMonica: You be okay?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?\nMonica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.\nRoss and Rachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Mmm.  Oh, no-\nRachel: Sorry-\nRoss: No no no, go-\nRachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-\nRoss: Split it?\nRachel: Okay.\nRoss: Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.\nRachel: I knew.\nRoss: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.\nRachel: I did.\nRoss: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?\nRachel: Yeah, maybe...\nRoss: Okay... okay, maybe I will...\nRachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Goodnight.\nMonica: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?\nRoss: I just grabbed a spoon.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump?

You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\nMonica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.\nChandler:  Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!\nMonica: What?\nChandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!\nAll: Eeaagh!\nRachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?\nPhoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful.\nRachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....\nPhoebe: No, look, don't touch that!\nRachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\nMonica: Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!\nChandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!\nJoey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?\nPhoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!\nChandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...\nRachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...\nChandler: ...Dinah?\nRachel:  Ohhhhh, don't be mad...\nMonica: You didn't.\nRachel: Oh, I am sorry...\nMonica: I gave you one job!\nRachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!\nChandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...\nMonica:  I just... can't do it.\nChandler: Boys? We're going in.\nRoss: .....Hi.\nMonica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.\nRoss: Carol's pregnant.\nPhoebe:  Ooh! I found it!\nMonica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...\nRoss: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.\nChandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?\nRachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?\nRoss: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.\nPhoebe: She is so great! I miss her.\nMonica: What does she mean by 'involved'?\nChandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.\nRoss: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.\nRachel: So what are you gonna do?\nRoss: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.\nJoey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #2]\nMonica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.\nChandler:  Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!\nRoss:  I'll have whatever Christine is having.\nRachel:  Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!\nPhoebe:  If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.\nChandler:  Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.\nJoey: I say push her down the stairs.\nPhoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\nRachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\nRoss: You can see where he'd have trouble.\nRachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\nMonica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\nRachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\nPhoebe:  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...\nRachel: I'm all better now.\nPhoebe:  I helped!\nMonica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.\nJoey:  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\nMonica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\nJoey: What, like there's a rule or something?\nChandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.\nPaul:  It's, uh, it's Paul.\nMonica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!\nJoey: Who's Paul?\nRoss: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\nMonica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\nRoss: He finally asked you out?\nMonica: Yes!\nChandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.\nMonica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...\nRachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!\nMonica:  Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\nRoss:  That'd be good...\nMonica:  Really?\nRoss:  No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!\nPhoebe: What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?\nMonica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\nAll: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!\nChandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\nMonica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...\nRoss: A wandering?\nMonica: Change!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.\nPhoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.\nJoey:  Hey, Paul!\nPaul: Yeah?\nJoey: Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.\nMonica:  Shut up, Joey!\nRoss: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?\nRachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\nRoss: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\nChandler:  Yes, and we're very excited about it.\nRachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.\nRoss: Okay, sure.\nJoey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?\nPhoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #3]\nRoss:  I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.\nJoey: I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.\nChandler: It's a beautiful thing.\nJoey:  What's this?\nChandler: I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.\nJoey: Which goes where?\nChandler: I have no idea.\nJoey: Done with the bookcase!\nChandler: All finished!\nRoss:  This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.\nJoey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.\nChandler: Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.\nJoey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?\nRoss: You guys.\nChandler: Oh, God.\nJoey: You got screwed.\nChandler: Oh my God!\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #1]\nRoss: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?\nMarsha: Well, she has issues.\nRoss: Does she.\nMarsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!\nRoss: Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?\nMarsha: Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?\nRoss:  No. No.\nMarsha: Yes, it is. Carol! Hi!\nRoss: Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age.\nRoss:Hi.\nCarol: So.\nRoss: You look great. I, uh... I hate that.\nCarol: Sorry. You look good too.\nRoss: Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh...\nCarol: A lesbian?\nRoss: Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?\nCarol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-\nRoss: Why- why are you here, Carol?\nCarol: I'm pregnant.\nRoss: Pregnant?!\n\n[Date: September 29, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.\nJoey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah!\nRachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.\nMonica: Absolutely.\nChandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.\nRoss: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.\nChandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.\nRachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.\nJoey: ....Are we still talking about sex?\n\n[Date: September 23, 1994, Session #1]\nJoey: Of course it was a line!\nMonica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?\nRoss: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.\nMonica: I hate men!  I hate men!\nPhoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.\nMonica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?\nPhoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.\nMonica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?\nJoey:  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!\nRachel: Guess what?\nRoss: You got a job?\nRachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.\nChandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.\nRachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!\nChandler: Oh, how well you know me...\nRachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!\nMonica: How'd you pay for them?\nRachel: Uh, credit card.\nMonica: And who pays for that?\nRachel: Um... my... father.\n\n",

      "[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #3]\nMrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm! What's that curry taste?\nMonica: Curry.\nMrs. Geller: Mmmm!\nRoss: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.\nMr. Geller:  Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?\nMrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him.\nRoss: Aw, Mom...\nMonica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?\nMrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-\nMonica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.\nMrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that...\nMonica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?\nRoss: Yeah.\nMrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.\nMonica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\nMrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.\nMr. Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!\nMrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...\nMonica: What's that supposed to mean?\nMrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.\nMonica: No it's not.\nMr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...\nMr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\nMr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.\nMonica:  So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\nRoss:  Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.\nMrs. Geller:  And you knew about this?!\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #1]\nRoss: No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?\nMarsha: Well, she has issues.\nRoss: Does she.\nMarsha: He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!\nRoss: Marsha, these are cave people.

How's, um.. how's the family?\nCarol: Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-\nRoss: Why- why are you here, Carol?\nCarol: I'm pregnant.\nRoss: Pregnant?!\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #2]\nChandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.\nPhoebe:...Then I've already seen this one!\nMonica:  Are you through with that?\nJoey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\nMonica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!\nChandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.\nPhoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!\nMonica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\nChandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\nPhoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.\nJoey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\nMonica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince.

We're going in.\nRoss: .....Hi.\nMonica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.\nRoss: Carol's pregnant.\nPhoebe:  Ooh! I found it!\nMonica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...\nRoss: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.\nChandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?\nRachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?\nRoss: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.\nPhoebe: She is so great! I miss her.\nMonica: What does she mean by 'involved'?\nChandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.\nRoss: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.\nRachel: So what are you gonna do?\nRoss: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.\nJoey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?\n\n[Date: September 23, 1994, Session #2]\nRachel: Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.\nMonica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.\nRachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.\nPhoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.\nRachel: Thank you.\nPhoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.\nRoss: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...\nMonica: All right, you ready?\nRachel: No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  \"Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\"  Come on, I can't do this!\nMonica: You can, I know you can!\nRachel: I don't think so.\nRoss: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!\nRoss: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...\nRachel: Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...\nMonica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\nChandler:  Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.\nMonica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!\nMonica: Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?\nRoss: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.\nMonica: You be okay?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?\nMonica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.\nRoss and Rachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Mmm.  Oh, no-\nRachel: Sorry-\nRoss: No no no, go-\nRachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-\nRoss: Split it?\nRachel: Okay.\nRoss: Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.\nRachel: I knew.\nRoss: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.\nRachel: I did.\nRoss: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?\nRachel: Yeah, maybe...\nRoss: Okay... okay, maybe I will...\nRachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Goodnight.\nMonica: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?\nRoss: I just grabbed a spoon.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #2]\nMonica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.\nChandler:  Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!\nRoss:  I'll have whatever Christine is having.\nRachel:  Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!\nPhoebe:  If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.\nChandler:  Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.\nJoey: I say push her down the stairs.\nPhoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\nRachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\nRoss: You can see where he'd have trouble.\nRachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\nMonica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\nRachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\nPhoebe:  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...\nRachel: I'm all better now.\nPhoebe:  I helped!\nMonica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.\nJoey:  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\nMonica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\nJoey: What, like there's a rule or something?\nChandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.\nPaul:  It's, uh, it's Paul.\nMonica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!\nJoey: Who's Paul?\nRoss: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\nMonica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\nRoss: He finally asked you out?\nMonica: Yes!\nChandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.\nMonica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...\nRachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!\nMonica:  Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\nRoss:  That'd be good...\nMonica:  Really?\nRoss:  No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!\nPhoebe: What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?\nMonica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\nAll: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!\nChandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\nMonica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...\nRoss: A wandering?\nMonica: Change!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.\nPhoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.\nJoey:  Hey, Paul!\nPaul: Yeah?\nJoey: Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.\nMonica:  Shut up, Joey!\nRoss: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?\nRachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\nRoss: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\nChandler:  Yes, and we're very excited about it.\nRachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.\nRoss: Okay, sure.\nJoey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?\nPhoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #4]\nJoey: Your folks are really that bad, huh?\nRoss: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.\nMonica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours.\nRoss: Must pee.\nPhoebe: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.\nRachel: You're twins?\nPhoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.\nChandler: What does she do?\nPhoebe: She's a waitress.\nRachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.\nMonica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.\nChandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.\nRachel: The lights, please..\nRoss: ...How long was I in there?\nRachel: I'm just cleaning up.\nRoss: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?\nRachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!\nRoss: Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?\nRachel: Oh.. a little..\nRoss: Mm-hmm..\nRachel: A lot.\nRoss: Mm.\nRachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?\nRoss: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...\nRachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?\nRoss: Got me.\nRachel: Remember when we were in high school together?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross?\nRoss: Yes, yes!\nRachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..\nRoss: Me either...\n\n[Date: September 23, 1994, Session #1]\nJoey: Of course it was a line!\nMonica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?\nRoss: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.\nMonica: I hate men!  I hate men!\nPhoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.\nMonica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?\nPhoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.\nMonica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?\nJoey:  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!\nRachel: Guess what?\nRoss: You got a job?\nRachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.\nChandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.\nRachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!\nChandler: Oh, how well you know me...\nRachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!\nMonica: How'd you pay for them?\nRachel: Uh, credit card.\nMonica: And who pays for that?\nRachel: Um... my... father.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #3]\nRoss:  I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.\nJoey: I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.\nChandler: It's a beautiful thing.\nJoey:  What's this?\nChandler: I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.\nJoey: Which goes where?\nChandler: I have no idea.\nJoey: Done with the bookcase!\nChandler: All finished!\nRoss:  This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.\nJoey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.\nChandler: Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.\nJoey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?\nRoss: You guys.\nChandler: Oh, God.\nJoey: You got screwed.\nChandler: Oh my God!\n\n[Date: September 29, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it.\nJoey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?\nPhoebe: Oh, yeah!\nRachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.\nMonica: Absolutely.\nChandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out.\nRoss: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket.\nChandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake.\nRachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone.\nJoey: ....Are we still talking about sex?\n\n",

      "[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #3]\nMrs. Geller: Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm! What's that curry taste?\nMonica: Curry.\nMrs. Geller: Mmmm!\nRoss: I- I think they're great! I, I really do.\nMr. Geller:  Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?\nMrs. Geller: They all had a thing for him.\nRoss: Aw, Mom...\nMonica: I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?\nMrs. Geller: Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-\nMonica: No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant.\nMrs. Geller: Well, they don't have to know that...\nMonica: Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?\nRoss: Yeah.\nMrs. Geller: Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy.\nMonica: I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me.\nMrs. Geller: What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing very well.\nMr. Geller: I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!\nMrs. Geller: Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar...\nMonica: What's that supposed to mean?\nMrs. Geller: Nothing! It's an expression.\nMonica: No it's not.\nMr. Geller: Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...\nMr. Geller: Look, there are people like Ross who need to shoot for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer.\nMr. Geller: ...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem.\nMonica:  So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?\nRoss:  Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby.\nMrs. Geller:  And you knew about this?!\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #2]\nChandler: Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding.\nPhoebe:...Then I've already seen this one!\nMonica:  Are you through with that?\nJoey: Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down.\nMonica: Whose little ball of paper is this?!\nChandler: Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead.\nPhoebe: She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!\nMonica: Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have.\nChandler: Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow.\nPhoebe: Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way.\nJoey: Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come.\nMonica: That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born.\nChandler:  Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!\nMonica: What?\nChandler: Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!\nAll: Eeaagh!\nRachel: Has anybody seen my engagement ring?\nPhoebe: Yeah, it's beautiful.\nRachel: Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God....\nPhoebe: No, look, don't touch that!\nRachel: Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder...\nMonica: Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!\nChandler and Joey: Oh! Yeah!\nJoey: Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?\nPhoebe: Doy! Probably right before she lost it!\nChandler: You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...\nRachel: I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with...\nChandler: ...Dinah?\nRachel:  Ohhhhh, don't be mad...\nMonica: You didn't.\nRachel: Oh, I am sorry...\nMonica: I gave you one job!\nRachel: Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!\nChandler: Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne...\nMonica:  I just... can't do it.\nChandler: Boys? We're going in.\nRoss: .....Hi.\nMonica: Wow. That is not a happy hi.\nRoss: Carol's pregnant.\nPhoebe:  Ooh! I found it!\nMonica: W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...\nRoss: Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now.\nChandler: Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?\nRachel: Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?\nRoss: Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me.\nPhoebe: She is so great! I miss her.\nMonica: What does she mean by 'involved'?\nChandler: I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done.\nRoss: Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow.\nRachel: So what are you gonna do?\nRoss: I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father.\nJoey: .....Well, this is still ruined, right?\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #1]\nMonica: There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\nJoey: C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\nChandler: All right Joey, be nice.  So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\nPhoebe: Wait, does he eat chalk?\nPhoebe: Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\nMonica: Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex.\nChandler: Sounds like a date to me.\nChandler: Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\nAll: Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\nChandler: Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\nJoey: Instead of...?\nChandler: That's right.\nJoey: Never had that dream.\nPhoebe: No.\nChandler: All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\nMonica: And they weren't looking at you before?!\nChandler: Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird, because- she never calls me!\nRoss:  Hi.\nJoey: This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\nMonica: Are you okay, sweetie?\nRoss: I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\nChandler: Cookie?\nMonica:  Carol moved her stuff out today.\nJoey: Ohh.\nMonica:  Let me get you some coffee.\nRoss: Thanks.\nPhoebe: Ooh! Oh!\nRoss: No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\nPhoebe: Fine!  Be murky!\nRoss: I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\nMonica: No you don't.\nRoss: No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\nJoey: And you never knew she was a lesbian...\nRoss: No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\nChandler: Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?\nRoss: I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\nMonica: Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., \"I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren.\" was what?  A wrong number?\nRoss: Sorry.\nJoey: Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\nJoey: Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\nRoss: I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!\nChandler: And I just want a million dollars!\nMonica: Rachel?!\nRachel: Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\nWaitress: Can I get you some coffee?\nMonica:  De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross?\nRachel: Hi, sure!\nRoss: Hi.\nMonica: So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\nRachel: Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\nMonica: Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\nRachel: Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\n\n[Date: October 1, 1994, Session #3]\nSusan: Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?\nRoss: Helen Geller? I don't think so.\nCarol: Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.\nRoss: Thank you!\nCarol: No, I mean it's not Geller.\nRoss: What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?\nCarol: No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch.\nRoss: Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?\nSusan: It's my baby too.\nRoss: Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm.\nSusan: Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!\nCarol: All right, you two, stop it!\nRoss: No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too.\nCarol: Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.\nRoss: Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch.\nSusan: Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!\nRoss: My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-\nDr. Oberman:  Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?\nAll: Yeah. Yeah. A little.\nDr. Oberman: Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing.  Uh, lie back..\nRoss: You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now.\nRoss: Oh my God.\nSusan: Look at that.\nCarol: I know.\n\n[Date: September 23, 1994, Session #2]\nRachel: Oh God, come on you guys, is this really necessary?  I mean, I can stop charging anytime I want.\nMonica: C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life.\nRachel: I know that. That's why I was getting married.\nPhoebe: Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time.\nRachel: Thank you.\nPhoebe: You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just killed herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windshields outside port authority, and then he killed himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.\nRoss: The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...\nMonica: All right, you ready?\nRachel: No.  No, no, I'm not ready!  How can I be ready?  \"Hey, Rach!  You ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute?\"  Come on, I can't do this!\nMonica: You can, I know you can!\nRachel: I don't think so.\nRoss: Come on, you made coffee!   You can do anything!\nRoss: C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut...\nRachel: Y'know what?  I think we can just leave it at that.  It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...\nMonica:  Rachel!  That was a library card!\nAll: Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..\nChandler:  Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.\nMonica: Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!\nMonica: Well, that's it  You gonna crash on the couch?\nRoss: No. No, I gotta go home sometime.\nMonica: You be okay?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?\nMonica: That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody.\nRoss and Rachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Mmm.  Oh, no-\nRachel: Sorry-\nRoss: No no no, go-\nRachel: No, you have it, really, I don't want it-\nRoss: Split it?\nRachel: Okay.\nRoss: Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you.\nRachel: I knew.\nRoss: You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.\nRachel: I did.\nRoss: Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?\nRachel: Yeah, maybe...\nRoss: Okay... okay, maybe I will...\nRachel: Goodnight.\nRoss: Goodnight.\nMonica: See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?\nRoss: I just grabbed a spoon.\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #2]\nMonica: Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.\nChandler:  Tuna or egg salad?  Decide!\nRoss:  I'll have whatever Christine is having.\nRachel:  Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!\nPhoebe:  If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.\nChandler:  Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.\nJoey: I say push her down the stairs.\nPhoebe, Ross, Chandler, and Joey:  Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\nRachel: C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\nRoss: You can see where he'd have trouble.\nRachel: Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\nMonica: Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\nRachel: Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!\nMonica: Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\nPhoebe:  Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens,  bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string.  These are a few...\nRachel: I'm all better now.\nPhoebe:  I helped!\nMonica: Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life.  The whole, 'hat' thing.\nJoey:  And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\nMonica: Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\nJoey: What, like there's a rule or something?\nChandler: Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.\nPaul:  It's, uh, it's Paul.\nMonica: Oh God, is it 6:30?  Buzz him in!\nJoey: Who's Paul?\nRoss: Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\nMonica: Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\nRoss: He finally asked you out?\nMonica: Yes!\nChandler: Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.\nMonica: Rach, wait, I can cancel...\nRachel: Please, no, go, that'd be fine!\nMonica:  Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\nRoss:  That'd be good...\nMonica:  Really?\nRoss:  No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!\nPhoebe: What does that mean?   Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?\nMonica: Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\nAll: Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!\nChandler: I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\nMonica: Okay, umm-umm, I'll just--I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...\nRoss: A wandering?\nMonica: Change!  Okay, sit down.  Two seconds.\nPhoebe: Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.\nJoey:  Hey, Paul!\nPaul: Yeah?\nJoey: Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.\nMonica:  Shut up, Joey!\nRoss: So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?\nRachel: Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\nRoss: Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\nChandler:  Yes, and we're very excited about it.\nRachel: Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.  It's been kinda a long day.\nRoss: Okay, sure.\nJoey: Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?\nPhoebe: Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.\n\n[Date: September 30, 1994, Session #4]\nJoey: Your folks are really that bad, huh?\nRoss: Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done.\nMonica: Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours.\nRoss: Must pee.\nPhoebe: Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.\nRachel: You're twins?\nPhoebe: Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type.\nChandler: What does she do?\nPhoebe: She's a waitress.\nRachel: All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.\nMonica: Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this.\nChandler: Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred.\nRachel: The lights, please..\nRoss: ...How long was I in there?\nRachel: I'm just cleaning up.\nRoss: D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?\nRachel: Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks!\nRoss: Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?\nRachel: Oh.. a little..\nRoss: Mm-hmm..\nRachel: A lot.\nRoss: Mm.\nRachel: So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?\nRoss: Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN...\nRachel: Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?\nRoss: Got me.\nRachel: Remember when we were in high school together?\nRoss: Yeah.\nRachel: I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross?\nRoss: Yes, yes!\nRachel: Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here..\nRoss: Me either...\n\n[Date: September 22, 1994, Session #3]\nRoss:  I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs.\nJoey: I'm thinking we've got a bookcase here.\nChandler: It's a beautiful thing.\nJoey:  What's this?\nChandler: I would have to say that is an 'L'-shaped bracket.\nJoey: Which goes where?\nChandler: I have no idea.\nJoey: Done with the bookcase!\nChandler: All finished!\nRoss:  This was Carol's favorite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known.\nJoey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, if you're gonna start with that stuff we're outta here.\nChandler: Yes, please don't spoil all this fun.\nJoey: Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?\nRoss: You guys.\nChandler: Oh, God.\nJoey: You got screwed.\nChandler: Oh my God!\n\n[Date: September 23, 1994, Session #1]\nJoey: Of course it was a line!\nMonica: Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?\nRoss: I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.\nMonica: I hate men!  I hate men!\nPhoebe: Oh no, don't hate, you don't want to put that out into the universe.\nMonica: Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?\nPhoebe: All right, c'mere, gimme your feet.\nMonica: I just thought he was nice, y'know?\nJoey:  I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!\nRachel: Guess what?\nRoss: You got a job?\nRachel: Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.\nChandler: And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.\nRachel: You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!\nChandler: Oh, how well you know me...\nRachel: They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!\nMonica: How'd you pay for them?\nRachel: Uh, credit card.\nMonica: And who pays for that?\nRachel: Um... my... father.\n\n[Date: October 1, 1994, Session #2]\nRoss: So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?\nCarol: Give me a 'for instance'.\nRoss: Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?\nCarol: Marlon-\nRoss: Marlon?!\nCarol: -if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl.\nRoss: ...As in Mouse?\nCarol: As in my grandmother.\nRoss: Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?\nCarol: Julia..\nSusan: We agreed on Minnie.\nRoss: 'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?\n\n",
