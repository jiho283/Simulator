You have to judge the correctness of a <prediction> to a corresponding <question>, based on <true answer>.

If the <prediction> seems to say the same thing as the <true answer>, you should say that the <prediction> is correct.
Otherwise, you should say that the <prediction> is wrong.

Your answer should follow the json format below:

```json
{
    "correct": True or False in Boolean format,
    "wrong": True or False in Boolean format, 
}
```

Only one of the "correct" and "wrong" should be True, and the other should be False.
"correct" and "wrong" can't be False at the same time.
